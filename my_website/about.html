    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>

    <p class="para">
        Hi, my name is Vinh! I am a junior who aspires to understand everything about computer science. 
        You might call me weird, but I look forward to seeing myself improving in this field.
        If you had asked me what my favorite aspect about school was a year ago, then I would have said that I didn't have one.
        But If you ask me right now then, then it would be learning something that I actually want to learn. 
        I am ecstatic to finally learn computer science. My definition of fun is being able to relax and not having to worry about anything.
        Unfortunately, fun can't be found in school. I wish I could just forget everything about school and just type code all day.
