            Hi, my name is Vinh! I am a junior who aspires to understand everything about computer science. 
            You might call me weird, but I look forward to seeing myself improving in this field.
            A life goal of mine is to make the coolest websites and apps that everyone uses.
            If you had asked me what my favorite aspect about school was a year ago, then I would have said that I didn't have one.
            But If you ask me right now then, then it would be learning something that I actually want to learn. 
            Something that I do for fun would be anything that is not homework.
            </p>
